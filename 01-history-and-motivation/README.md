# 01. History and Motivation

Continuous Integration (CI) has dramatically transformed the way we build, test, and deliver software. What once took weeks or months is now handled in minutes, thanks to decades of innovation in tooling and process.

## Speed of Software Delivery over Time

The time between writing and shipping software has shrunk drastically over the decades:

| Era             | Delivery Method               | Turnaround Time        |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| 🧮 1960s–70s      | **Punch cards / Mainframes**    | Forever? 😅         |
| 💾 1980s–90s      | **Floppy disks, CDs**          | Months.              |
| 🌐 2000s          | **Server deployments**         | Daily to weekly      |
| ☁️ 2010s–Now      | **CI/CD pipelines & cloud**     | Multiple times per day |
